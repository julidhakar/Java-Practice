* why interface: for multiple inheritance

* Interface variable are always public static final because it interfaces can not be instantiate on their own.
  and constant modifier
  ensures the value assigned to the interface variable is a true constant that can not be re-assigned.

* interface can extends multiple interface

* all the concrete class should have implement all the interface methods
