# Threads:  thread is a lightweight process, in java we can create multiple threads inside and process.

# Threads can be implemented in 2 ways:
1. using implement runnable interface (Runnable interface is having only one abstract method i,e run)
2. using extend Thread class (Thread class have multiple methods)

pros & cons:

multiple inheritance: using runnable multiple inheritance is possible, thread class will not allow 
                      multiple inheritance
Thread safety : when we implement runnable same object shared amongst multiple threads , but when we use 
                Thread a new object is associated with each thread.

# Volatile keyword:

# Race Condition:
  Race condition occurs when 2 or more threads access shared data, nd try to change it at same time. problem offten occurs
  when one thread does a check-then-act. and in between 2nd thread has changes the value to check. 

   1. if(x == 5){
   2.    y = x*2;
   }

# difference between notify and notifyall
  notify will notify only one tread from all the threads which are waiting on same object, 
  and random thread will get notify.

  NotifyAll will notify all the threads and any one of them will get the lock on the object.


# wait(), sleep(), yield()
  wait will get call from synchronized block, when wait method will get call thread will go to waiting state
  it will come to runnbale once notify and notify all will get call

  sleep(): is get call on thread. it will come to runnable state once sleep time is over

  yield(): it stops thread for unpredictable time, that depends on scheduler
